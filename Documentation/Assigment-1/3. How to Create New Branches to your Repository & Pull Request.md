# How to Create New Branches to your Repository & Pull Request?


### What are Branches?
Branches are an essential part to the GitHub experience because they're where we can make changes without affecting the entire project we're working on.
Your branch is a safe place to experiment with new features or fixes. If you make a mistake, you can revert your changes or push more changes to fix the mistake. Your changes won't update on the default branch until you merge your branch.
